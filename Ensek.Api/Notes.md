## Entity Framework
### Create database with migrations
1. Add a migration:
   ```bash
    dotnet ef migrations add InitialCreate
   ```
2. Update the database:
   ```bash
    dotnet ef database update
   ```
   This creates MeterReadings.db in your app's root directory
3. If you see the error 'Could not execute because the specified command or file was not found.', 
you may need to install the EF Core tools:
   ```bash
    dotnet tool install --global dotnet-ef
   ```
